## MiniBill :: PHP Open Source Billing ##

---

Minibill was originally created because I was tired of paying for features I never used in a recurring billing software.  So I endeavored to create something that is easy to modify and simple to understand.  MiniBill uses [Smarty Templates](http://smarty.net) and basic PHP to keep things simple for novices, yet remains extendible enough for those looking to add something extra.

**Check it out, and you will see what I mean!**

Some features of MiniBill include:

  * Smarty Templates
  * Easily Extendible
  * Works in PHP Safe Mode
  * Recurring Billing
  * Paypal support
  * Shopping cart
